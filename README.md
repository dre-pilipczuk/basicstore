# Basic Store
Given more time, I would have liked to
- Unit test ViewModels
- Unit / UI test UI
- Clean up gradle dependencies and unify version numbers (paramerterise them for easier maintenance)
- Used a database for the cart instead of a simple in memory list
- Explored the possibility of making the ViewModels pure kotlin so they could be pure Kotlin modules
- Added a bit more information on product items (used Coil to display it's image etc)
